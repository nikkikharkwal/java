/*
Description

You are given three numbers, stored in variables with the following names
one, two, three
You have to find the square of the three numbers, and find the sum of their square values
Note : Square of a number, is a number multiplied by itself. For example, the square of 3, is 3 * 3 = 9


Input
The first and the only line of the input contains, the values stored inone, two, three

Output
Print the sum of the squares of the values stored inone, two, three

Sample Input 1 

1 2 3
Sample Output 1

14
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored inone = 1, two = 2, three = 3.

The square of the values stored will be

one = 1 * 1 = 1

two = 2 * 2 = 4

three = 3 * 3 = 9

The resultant sum becomesone + two + three = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14, which is the required answer.
