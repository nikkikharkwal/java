/*
Description

You are given a number, stored in a variable with the namenumber. Perform the following operations on the value stored in the number

1. Multiply the value by 3
2. Add 7 after it
3. Subtract 10 from it
After performing all the above operations, print the updated value


Input
The first and the only line of the input contains the number, stored in the variablenumber

Constraints

1 <= N <= 30


Output
Print a single integer, denoting the updated value of the number stored, after performing all the operations, given in the problem statement


Sample Input 1 

4
Sample Output 1

9
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored in the variablenumberis 4.

After multiplying the value by 3, the value gets updated to 12

After that, we add 7 to it, so the number gets updated to 19

Finally, we subtract 10 from it, so the value becomes 9, which is the final output.
