/*
Description

You are given five numbers, stored in the variables with the following names

one, two, three, four, five

All the values are doubled, that is, they are multiplied by 2

Find the sum of the values stored inone, two, three, four, after the above operation are performed


Input
The first and the only line of the input contains the values stored in variablesone, two, three, four, five

Output
Print the sum of the values stored inone, two, three, four,five, after the required operation is performed

Sample Input 1 

1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output 1

30
Hint

In the sample test case, the values stored in the variables are as follows

one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five = 5

After doubling all the values, the values become

one = 1*2 = 2

two = 2*2 = 4

three = 3*2 = 6

four = 4*2 = 8

five = 5*2 = 10

Therefore, the sum becomes2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30, which is the required output
